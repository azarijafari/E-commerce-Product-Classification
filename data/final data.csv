a14eb4b5-7763-464f-919b-e72804270f9a,Kitchen,Bartelli Soft Edge Automatic Electric Can Opener - Blue,5,"[[VIDEOID:70222cbf9d5b236177117b19f391038e]]After many years our electric can opener had died. We had a manual one as a backup, but we both had so much trouble trying to get it to work, that we tried another one.  My fiance can get the newer manual one to work but I can't, I have to squeeze so hard that it hurts my wrist.  When I saw that Bartelli was looking for reviewers of their Soft Edge Automatic Can Opener, I applied right away.<br /><br />Thankfully they selected me and provided me with an Amazon code to order the blue version for free.  When it arrived I quickly ran to the store to get some AAA batteries which are not included so I could test it out.<br /><br />At first I was making it out to be harder than it really was.  You simply mount the can opener on the can, press the button to turn on, let can opener swivel around the can, press the button again to turn off the can opener when it has made a complete circle.  Because the can stays flat on the counter, I don't have to worry about any contents spilling out, especially on larger cans like when I used a stand up electric can opener.<br /><br />I love that this design doesn't take up much space, and can be stored in a drawer.  Our counter  space is very limited so not having to plug this can opener in makes prepping meals at the kitchen table a  breeze.<br /><br />This product cuts around the side of the can to eliminate sharp and dangerous edges, creating an easily re-sealable lid with a smooth edge. That makes it easy to keep food covered while preparing a meal.<br /><br />This is perfect for those with carpal tunnel issues, arthritis or any other hand pain, as it requires no manual labor."

afd402e6-1bba-43d4-9ef7-b3706409e38c,Jewelry,Gay Rainbow Sisters Gay Pride Leather Bracelet Wristlet,4,I like the fit and the colors. They are not faded. Its well made and I think its pretty durable. The only hing i dislike is the left over string where they finished tying it. It sticks out and the string is coming undone. It doesnt affect the bracelet though because it cant undo itself more than where they tied it.

dbd8ada8-2755-4867-8dc2-8046a235c46a,Kitchen,Inspired Basics Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch 316L Highest Grade Stainless Steel Cast Iron Skillet Cleaner,5,"I just received this today and I did use it on one of my Lodge pans that was clean but had a few carbon pieces that had become part of the pan over the years. It very easily knocked those pieces off. I've been wanting some of this (or one of these) for a while but I find it easy enough to take care of cast iron without anything special. Depending on what you do with your pans though, sometimes nothing works as well as a specialized piece designed for that very purpose. Let me say though, I have never used one of these before nor have I ever seen or handled them anywhere else so I cannot say how this compares to the other pieces of chainmail on the market. So that being said, this is heavy duty, well put together and a good grade of stainless and as I said, it works... And it did something that I was going to have to use something like a chisel or perhaps a strong flat head screwdriver for (although I didn't want to take the chance of gouging the pan surface). There is merit to &#34;the right tool for the right job&#34;. I got this at a promotional price in exchange for an honest review (to be fair, they never said they expected a review of any kind so maybe &#34;in exchange&#34; is the wrong term but that's implied). Honestly, I do not think I would have purchased this otherwise even though I said I have wanted one, for a few reasons, one is my cast iron has been meticulously cared for and has a great no stick surface so clean up is a snap, and another is I don't really use the pans for let's say a scrambled egg and cheese casserole or something that has the potential to be that messy... That is where I could see something like this coming into its own and were that the case, I would be all over something such as this. And that's why the 4 stars rather than 5. For me, this is a very specialized utensil, and as of yet I don't really see any other use for it. If this hits the mark for you, then yes, 5 stars for the build and materials and the company. If I figure outanother use for this, I'll let you know. ***************** I just changed this from 4 to 5 stars, this thing is great for cleaning grill grates and also the grill ridges in a stove top griddle, as long as it's not coated with something like Teflon. Now this has multiple uses for me and that's the fifth star!"

7026f0cc-8370-4abf-a2d8-1f59244f0700,Jewelry,Aiyaya Jewelry Vintage Grand Choker Rhinestones Fashion Necklace,5,"Simply stunning! Being from South Louisiana, we attend a lot of formal Mardi Gras balls, Twelfth Night parties, Festival balls, etc.  This is the perfect piece of jewelry to dress up a simple formal or semi-formal gown. The necklace incorporates lots of colors and could really be paired with a multitude of things. I like big, chunky, glamorous jewelry, and this is definitely a stunner! I have a lot of my great grandmother's antique jewelry and this reminds me of something from the 1940's. The colors of the necklace remind me of the beaches of Cancun and the beautiful shades of blue waters and the yellow sunshine. It comes packaged in a red velvet drawstring bag. Mine came in with a stone missing, I assume from shipping, but I am working on getting it exchanged as I type. This is definitely not a cheap, lightweight piece! It is so much more than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised! I do not think you will be disappointed at all with this piece, especially for the price!

The overall length is 3 1/8 inches and the central spike is 1 1/4 inches.  The central spike extends beyond the screw.  Inserting them is simplicity itself.  Press the central spike into the cob, and then screw it in.  Holds the corn firmly until you're finished eating.  Then simply unscrew and remove.  Note that these are designed to work with corn that has been cut on both ends.  Longevitity is the only question, but these holders look and feel plenty sturdy.  Highly recommended.<br />(10/31/2017)  Here I am again. After two years of chomping these holders are still going strong with no issues whatsoever. I only use four as I gave the other four to a friend shortly after purchase.  As I said before, “Best I've Ever Used !!”"

d8d4ae14-d838-4395-a039-fd2a3b1b5e28,Kitchen,Keurig 2.0 K350 Brewing System - Black,4,This brewer provides many choices as far as cup sizes are concerned. That's a real plus for the selecting the tiny to the large. It also has the carafe that comes in handy when several people are drinking the same flavor. One drawback is that choices of flavors are restricted to cups with the Kuerig  logo. But we have found satisfactory flavored creamers that satisfy different preferences.<br />The reminder to change the filter is a good idea since maintenance is hard for me to keep track of.<br />The choice to brew tea and hot chocolate will probably be used as the weather turns cold and hot beverages are a real necessity.<br />The bottom line is that I really like this model much better than the older one that was used for several years.

5f74113f-aaa3-43ab-97b6-d34e56bc14f2,Jewelry,BodyJ4You 18PCS Gauge Tunnel Kit 14G-00G Stainless Steel Ear Plugs Stretching Set Single Flared Expanders,5,"If you're wondering from the slightly ambiguous wording in the item description (you know how some sellers would consider the tunnel one piece and the o-ring as another = 2 pcs) -- you DO get two tunnels and two rings of each gauge.<br /><br />The 14 gauges aren't &#34;tunnels&#34; in that they're so small there is no &#34;tube&#34; through them- they are solid, but they do match the style of the rest of the tunnels with the flared fronts and ridged back for holding your o-ring..  getting that TINY o-ring on is tough because it's so small so you might need help (I did).  Also, the 14gs were slightly larger than a standard 14g ring or taper.. not enough that I felt the need to grab my 12g taper, but enough that I did notice there was a difference and it needed a little extra push to get them through.  However, I will say- sleeping with tunnels in your double helixes?  WAY more comfortable than sleeping with rings in them.<br /><br />To be noted- the O-Rings have to be tight- otherwise, they slip off easily and if the o-ring doesn't stay on, your tunnel will fall out in your sleep, and all that stretching progress can be lost- especially if you're working with cartilage, so tight o-rings are a GOOD thing.<br /><br />I have piercings of a variety of sizes in my ears, and have been wanting to gauge my lobes from their 6g & 4gs to 00gs for ever, and just never got around to it..  This kit is perfect for me because I like to stairstep my stretching with a variety of sizes all at once- so I've always got at least one side of my head that I can sleep on.<br /><br />This kit is lovely.  I would never believe that it was a $3 set (when I bought it).  The metal is smooth and polished.  The tunnels are sturdy.  The rings fit tightly.  They're all labeled in individual resealable packages..  Aside from the 14 gauges being slightly large, I can't find any flaws with any of them.<br />This set is definitely worth the gamble.<br /><br />Came back to edit a week later--<br />I justwanted to add- a week in- and no problems, no skin reactions, no signs of rust (some cheap sets do that), the rings have stayed tight, and I still love them on all counts.<br /><br />Came back a MONTH later--<br />Once again, I came in to add- it's been a month with them in- and NO problems, no signs of rust, no deterioration of the o-rings- and I still love them.<br /><br />Came back TWO YEARS later--<br />I am still using these.  I have the two 10g in my helixes- they have been in there from day one- taken out only for cleaning, they have gone through showers/baths and hair products being sprayed around them every day for that entire time.  No sign of rust, no irritations, no issues whatsoever.  Not a single tunnel in the set has given me any trouble.  As time went by a few of the smallest o-rings got a little hard- but that did not lessen their ability to do their jobs- and I'm still using the original o-rings on them.<br /><br />If I could give them a higher rating I would.  I just can't tell you enough- even at the new price- THIS SET IS WORTH THE MONEY.<br />Awesome set for an even awesome-r price."

I love that there is no mess with ice and salt!  I feel, your recipe will determine how hard or soft your ice cream ends up.  I used a recipe that I got years ago from milnot milk and it froze very nicely.  I was able to dip it and it hold shape by the time it was frozen!  You can see the ice cream churning and getting thick.  I like that I can add choc chips, nuts, coconut, or such towards the end through the opening in the lid... and the added bonus for me is being able to sneak a spoonful while it is freezing.  I read reviews about it being loud... I do agree-- it is loud, but it's worth it!  I like that it makes a small batch when it's just for me and my husband, but I do wish I could buy it in a bigger size too to use for family gatherings. You can buy extra bowls to keep in the freezer and make one batch after the other, but that doesn't serve everyone fresh ice cream at the same time.  I have to mention that I did buy some of the 6 oz tovolo ice cream containers to freeze leftovers in. While 6 oz may seem small, it is a nice portion to satisfy a sweet tooth without a ton of calories! When you are ready to eat one of them, the silicone lid stays soft and comes off easy.  If you let the ice cream set at room temp for just a few minutes (maybe 4-5 min) your spoon will dip in more easily.  I have even microwaved it for 10 seconds and that works great too.  I highly recommend this Ice Cream Maker... we use ours often!"

That may have been my fault, but I did read enough to reassure myself from the Amazon page that the grill was dishwasher safe; the manual, however, says to wash by hand with mild detergent, like most cast-iron.<br />I had hoped to use this grill in my oven as an adjunct to the normal broiler pan, but it is JUST too wide to do so. I started to slide it into the oven, but it was scraping the sides of the oven,so I desisted.  Its surface is rough enough that I fear it is also likely to scratch my glass cooktop, and the rough surface, large size, and weight make me also think it may scratch my sink when I clean it.<br />If I were big and strong, I think this might be a nice accessory for my outdoor grill, but it is not something I am willing to use in my kitchen.

7a10a71a-8b06-4eb7-b33b-a88d6b3e92c5,Kitchen,"The Original EDGY Wine Foil Cutter Accessory with Stunning Gift Box, Easy Wine Bottle Opening for Wine Lovers, Red",5,"I used to gaze at the fancier bottles of wine in my collection yearning to drink them, but completely befuddled as to how to find the bottle's cork.  I knew the cork was hiding somewhere underneath the shiny metal foil firmly affixed to the bottle neck, shimmering like an elusive mirage.  However, attempts to remove this stubborn oenophilic chastity belt with a knife or a scissors proved futile, and on one occasion practically fatal.  While awaiting paramedics to arrive after severing a major artery and collapsing face down in a puddle of my own blood, I vowed to never again risk my own life attempting to remove another dastardly wine foil.<br /><br />And so I was sadly relegated to drinking screw-top bottles of wine, doomed to live a pathetic, solitary life.  I soon learned that nobody wants to be with a man who only drinks screw top or boxed wines; that's no a man, that's a child.  Feeling hopeless and lonely, I decided to cash in my life savings and move to Minsk where I could spend the rest of my days drowning my sorrows in bottles of vodka with easily removable caps.<br /><br />In a shocking twist of fate, on the morning of the day I was set to leave on a one-way flight to Minsk with no possibility of return, I happened upon an advertisement for a life-saving product called Edgy.  Edgy provides a safe, reliable way to remove wine foils with no messes and no accidents.  Now, the fancy bottles of wine that used to mock and taunt me are crushed like ladybugs.  I guzzle Domaine Leflaive Montrachets, Screaming Eagle Cabernets, and Henri Jayer Richebourg Cotes de Nuits like bottles of water, all thanks to Edgy.  Yes, I am now drunk literally all of the time, but I'm also happily married (I think) to a woman (I think) who is stunningly beautiful (I think).  And it's all because of Edgy.<br /><br />So thank you, Edgy, for saving my life."

I read a lot of reviews and ended up getting this one. Had it a couple years and find it just is not useful. The small feed tube requires you to spend a lot of time prepping before you can actually juice. And this juicer does NOT does well with squishy fruit. Forget about juicing pineapple... it does not work. Anything squishy does not get pushed through the matiscator and you have to empty out the entire assembly to continue juicing. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who actually wants to juice regularly. You will spend way to much time for the whole process.

752b0d2c-adb6-4079-9af1-0fd9493090e3,Kitchen,Keurig Stainless Steel Travel Mug,3,"This travel mug serves its purpose in preventing leaks and spills, but it is not my favorite. It works great to keep your coffee hot for about an hour, and I can honestly say that it had never leaked. The unique button-release design is a simple yet effective approach to quickly taking a swig of coffee without having to fuss with cumbersome latches. However, there are two problems with this mug that I have encountered over a few months of use. 1. The hole that the coffee comes out of is much too small and makes it very difficult to sip hot coffee without burning yourself. This is a stark contrast to my yetti mug, which I use for both hot and cold beverages. 2. The lip of the plastic lid that you place into your mouth has a rough, grainy sort of texture. I prefer a slick, smooth plastic that resembles something closer to the feel of glass. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase, and I received my mug in a timely fashion. But, this is not my go-to mug for coffee."

So I was bummed when they didn't show off as nice on my ears. Everybody's ears are different, so I'm trying not to generalize, but on my ears, 2/3 of the earrings were off of my lobes and because of the weight, they sort of pull forward where the pin goes through and back at the bottom, so the earring hangs slanted backward. So people see more of the top of the setting, than the actual stones and it's hard to appreciate how pretty they are! I've never had this particular issue with earrings before, so I think they may be just slightly oddly weighted to look their best once they are in your ears. Still, the blues  are great and set off blue eyes really well and I'm sure for other people's ears they may look just as great in your ears as they do in the box."

Both systems are very easy to use and make a great cup of coffee.  Coffee from a regular coffee maker doesn't seem to taste as good anymore. I would never go back to a regular coffee maker! The particular machine is very easy to use and the color options are great.  I personally have the turquoise and I love the colors vibrancy! I also love that this machine has an option to make your coffee stronger. I prefer to have the water reservoir to the side rather than the back of the machine. Having the reservoir to the side allows it to be removed easily for filling without having to move the machine each time or use a cup to fill it. I also wish it had an option to make the coffee hotter.  The temperature is good but adding cream definitely makes it a little cooler than I prefer.  Keurigs customer service is also impeccable.  I had pods that only worked with my old machine.  I called them and they replaced them for free and no questions asked!!! Overall this is an excellent machine for the cost.  I would buy it again and recommend it anyone!!! Keep up the good work Keurig!!!

It just makes coffee like any other coffee maker.  I still have to heat it for 30 seconds for it to be hot enough for me just like I would any other normal coffee maker."

I have the Candy Apple Red and it's a stunner. Great addition to my kitchen arsenal.  I agree with the other reviewers on the cheap look and feel to the utensils.  Disappointing. I bought the mixing utensil with the rubber scraper blades on the edges from Amazon and highly recommend it.  Overall, this mixer blends and mixes most ingredients like a dream. I have not used the mixer heavily and when I do use it I tend to make cookie dough.  I have made pizza dough a couple of times and it's so amazing.<br /><br />The last two times I made cookie dough the motor audibly struggled after I added 2-1/4 cups of flour. I feel like this should not be happening.  Understandable maybe if I was making a double batch.  I'm hoping this isn't the start of a bigger problem. This along with the low quality of the utensils is why this item is rated 4 stars.<br /><br />I also bought the metal mixing bowl and highly recommend the pour shield."

This is by far the leader of the pack.  Not only does it keep coffee hotter for much longer then any of the others I have used, it is by far the best looking.  To tell the truth, I am not interested in size, shape, or anything else other then how long does my coffee stay hot.  Anything else is just a plus.  The best thing about this is it doesn't drip and is super easy to clean.  Only rubber and stainless steal come in contact with the beverage. We will be buying another one or two soon for camping and a wedding gift."

The magnets are strong and hold the knives shown in the picture securely. There is a template included for securing the rack to the  wall as well. The only thing I should mention is that it is best to pull a knife down to slide it off of the rack as opposed to pulling it away from the rack, the way it is secured to the wall allows the rack to lift off of the wall a little if you pull away, I'd think over time doing this would wear away the holes that it hangs from."

e300f3b3-8b79-45e5-8984-b7964eb97f2c,Kitchen,1 X Cast Aluminum Shrimp Deveiner and Cleaner,5,"I've tried many shrimp deveiners.  Forget the gimmics.<br /><br />You don't need scissors for shrimp.  You probably don't even have time for using scissors on shrimp.  Shrimp are small.  You need it deveined and peeled in 5 seconds because you have 50-100 more to do.  And stay away from serrated deveiners - they will tear up your shrimp, not cut the shells.  This simple, indestructible tool is absolutely the best deveiner, and one of the best gifts my mom ever gave me.<br /><br />It is true that the finish will immediately wear off in the dishwasher.  Wash it three cycles before you use it.  That is my plan.  I just ordered three of them.  I accidentally left my old one at the inlaws' house, so I bought a piece of garbage locally last weekend right before a dinner party because they didn't have this model in the upscale kitchen store I went to. (dinner was late).<br /><br />I can't stress enough how perfectly simple this thing is.  Others have commented that it will tear up smaller shrimp.  That is a possibility - it depends on the user.  You are buying a hand tool.  You have to learn to use it.  The finesse is in your fingers.  Just trust me, this is the best shrimp deveiner ever.  EVER.<br /><br />[By the way, it is made by Ecko, and the seller should state that.  Other listings for the same deveiner come with a heavy $18 for shipping.  No thanks!]"

This works just great! I love that is programmable. High, low, simmer and warm. I learned the first time around low is more like a high, if you are doing the &#34;drop and cook&#34; method, of more then 6 hours, i would use simmer and put it on 7 hours. I tend to leave the house around 7, and dont get back for 9 hours later. The meats are always cook to protection. I have been very pleased too with the ease of cleaning the pot.

f48c11f9-5ee4-4024-848a-a6922e56fac1,Kitchen,The Mexican Kitchen by Rick Bayless  4 quart Round Dutch Oven with Lid,5,"My family has been cooking with cast iron frying pans for 30+ years, but our pots have mostly been Calphalon.  Our Calphalon 6 Quart pot is used quite often and even though Calphalon does have a lifetime warranty, we decided to move to a cast iron setting.  Now with a cast iron grill and frying pans which we use with our gas stove, we are adding a Dutch Oven.  We will not really cook Mexican food, as we are stew and crockpot peoples.  You can cook all types of slow cooked foods in this.<br /><br />I like the fact that it is ceramic coated which makes clean up a breeze.  However, a basic cast iron product is easy to clean also.  We use plastic scrapers from Pampered Chef and they do a bang up job.<br /><br />There are little plastic clips that come with the unit so when you flip the lid over for storage you do not chip the unit.  These will fail.  Just get a large, soft cotton dishtowel to layer in between the pot and lid.  That will also help with moisture control."

bf2a6e1f-b854-471f-bf55-922318b87388,Kitchen,FOUR-C Baking Tools Labyrinth Textured Rolling Pin Fondant Tools Color Transparent,4,"I am a pastry chef by trade. These special design rolling pins are very handy to add to your design arsenal. It is a quick way to add design flare.<br /><br />What You Get: (1) FOUR-C Rolling Pin &#34;Labyrinth Textured&#34; design, Color: Clear (6.3&#34; inches length X 0.5&#34; inches width x 11.91mm thickness, weight: 0.6 ounces).<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />➔ This design is an interesting textural design element, it reminds me of the stacks of dumbbell weights, from a profile perspective, joined together.  Could also work for native peoples themed designs as well (see cons). Great for cookies or molding chocolate.<br /><br />➔ Instant Parkay Design. Roll your fondant, or pastry flat, then use this pin to imprint an parkay type textured pattern, wherever you roll it.<br /><br />➔ Modified PMMA (Poly(methyl methacrylate)). An economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not necessary. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits (BPA) found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when loaded, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA can achieve high scratch and impact resistance.<br /><br />➔ Easy to clean - run under warm water with dish detergent. Hand wash only.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />➔ Not heat or dishwasher safe.<br /><br />➔ I would be sensitive to what clients this rolling pin is used for. I just realized looking at it,there is a certain symbol that appears at each of the design joints all over the design, which has very negative connotations to a certain people. Native peoples however,have used this same symbol for millennia as a symbol of peace or prosperity.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Interesting textural element for random or native people themed parties. Uses are endless, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.ss, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result."

I have multiple ear piercings and am always buying studs that vary in size, so that i can have them go from big to small or vice versa. I also like these because I feel like the smaller sizes are good to wear second and third  ear piercings without seeming to big or awkward. I also really like how these earrings are packaged as the three smaller sizes come together on one card while the three larger ones come on a separate card.   If you only have one or two piercings I think the bigger sizes would be great for everyday use and if you are like me with multiple ear piercings I feel you will get a lot of use out of this set being able to mix and match the various earrings sizes. Overall I feel that these are perfect for everyday wear.  I did receive this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review."

I did not struggle to hold or operate them. I love that there is a convenient safety lock to hold the sharp blades together when not in use, so I don't have to worry about hands and fingers getting into harm's way.<br /><br />I was especially excited to see how these scissors stood up to the challenge of cutting meat and veggies, rather than just herbs like those I have used in the past. I was able to cut carrots, green onions, and cucumbers just for fun, but I was most impressed with how easily the blades glided through the layers of my rotisserie chicken.

Once you get your package you will instalty know it's heavy quality stainless steel material. It comes with a extra silicone peeler to remove the skin from the garlic.  You can add about 2 or more garlic depending on the size. You can get the job of chopping up garlic easy and fast. I usually cut it up and store some in a tight glass container for later use. This garlic pressed is easy to use. And easy to clean. Can be washed in dishwasher.  It is durable, convenient and a nice kitchen addition. It has a beautiful design and I can get a great grip. Feels good in my hand I can feel the job getting done easy and fast. Doesn't rust. Check this product and give it a try.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own real honest opinion about the product."

Someone had told us once in a reading we did for fun, that we're like two braids woven together joined by our karmic destinies. Though we took it lightly, it meant something, and this ring seemed like the perfect way to say I remember...my friend loved it.<br /><br />This ring has tiny diamonds set into the braids weaving in and out and shine and sparkle. The ring is very well made and great enough for every day wear. Since it marked something special my friend wanted to wear it on special occasions as it can catch dirt due to it's design.<br /><br />This ring was perfect for a gift as it came in a beautiful and heavy black ring box in a leather like finish with a gold embossed pattern. There was a white outer cardboard box to protect the ring box on the inside.<br />[Received free or discounted product to test for a candid review]"

I love the look of pierced nipples but not the whole.... everything else so I thought these would be perfect. &#34;Would be perfect&#34; if they fit, but alas, they did not. I didn't think my nipples were on the small size, I guess I should have paid more attention. I even bent the sides of the loop (squished in) and they stayed on... until I moved. So if your nipple is less than the 10 cm wide, I'd pass."

I just can't pour water into the unit without a deluge on the counter no mater what position or speed I try and  I now take my cup to the sink to pour my coffee to catch the excessive dribble.<br />  I have contacted De Longhi CUSTOMER SERVICE to see if they have a solution and I am waiting for their reply. The problem (as I see it) is the carafe has a plastic lip completely around the top and it disrupts the flow from the spout.<br />  In the meantime I have been using the glass carafe from my De Longhi DC76T 12 cup coffee maker which is all glass (except for the lid and it works well. I purchased the DCF6214T to replace the damaged DC76T and thankfully I hadn't discarded the old unit yet.<br />  I would hope De Longhi will see the problem and have a &#34;Recall/Replacement&#34; program for the current Glass Carafe's.

They do take a little extra practice to learn how to use, so don't try them the first time on a multi batch canning day, load the canner with your 7 jars, and see how they do when you follow the instructions.  The lid has to be secured just right.  I usually apply more pressure to these than I do when I can with the metal jars, but practice makes perfect.  I have found a superior seal with these.  These can be difficult to open, but to me they are well worth it.  I don't have to run to the store to buy more lids, or worry about getting things in advance.  I know how many jars I need for the year, and that is how many lids I have.  Great product."

It is unique.  You get a pack of 3 and they are 1 size small (size 3-5), 1 size medium (size 5-9), and 1 size large (size 7-12).  You can resize your ring in no time.  It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, but once you get it figured out, it will be your favorite ring sizer.  I love that it has the ring safety feature. You never have to worry about losing your rings. It works with multiple rings and gives you a snug fit.  They are comfortable to wear.  I received these at a discount for my honest review and I must say they are awesome.  I would recommend these to anyone who wears rings."

a70f847f-dab6-4649-ab48-2f794130f672,Kitchen,Hamilton Beach Toastation Toaster Oven,2,"Received it on the day promised. I have the previous model so, this review will be a comparison. PROS: Taller oven area (about 1/4&#34; more) so although still not as roomy as my  B&D (in toaster-oven heaven), finally, I can roast an open-faced deli sandwich. Larger oven window. Overall size of the appliance is about the same as the previous model. HB kept the toaster lever; thank Goodness as that is easier for my elderly father. CONS: The image is deceiving. Although the toaster opening is about the same (1-1/4&#34;), unbelievably, the space between the grills that holds the slices was greatly reduced to a mere 3/4&#34;! We routinely have Costco bagels that you have to slice yourself; even if you're wide awake and cut the bagel evenly, you'll find yourself coaxing the slices between the grills - now, if you toast only bread slices, you'll be fine. It may be my appliance, but the oven door hinge is not tight enough to keep the door closed; if I tilt it forward slightly to do some clean-up, the door swings open and slams on the counter. As mentioned in a previous review, there is a beep that sounds for every darn thing you do .. plug in, unplug, turn on the toaster and when it's done. The worst beeping is when it's done ... 3 or 4 long, annoying beeps with 2 second intervals. Would have been okay if it was just one, but for crying out loud, HB, there are those of us who are up very early with the family still asleep ... now, we're having to rush to shut it off so that the rest of house doesn't wake up at 5am. 2 stars for keeping the toaster feature separate and for the larger oven area. However, HB took steps backwards with the toaster slot reduction and that annoying beeping for everything! After this morning, I'm not so sure we'll be keeping this one."

We wanted to get these so we could put ice cubes in small neck reusable water bottles. Standard ice cube trays make ice too big. These ice cubes work, but if there is any overflow and the water is coming across the top of the squares, good luck getting that huge chunk out of the tray. Filling these takes some skill that I have not developed yet. Right now, as these sit in my freezer, only half of each tray is usable. The other half is stuck to the tray. No amount of bending and flexing has been able to dislodge the slab of ice. My advice, if there is any overflow, dump it out and try again. I also do not have the patience to fill ALL the squares. It takes a fair bit of patience to fill all the squares."

Our previous unit had worked reliably for six years, which we know because Amazon tells me I purchased it in June, 2009. The LEDs started dying off about a year ago, and now it is mostly comatose. Time for a replacement. And the reasons for going with the same model are: (1) makes toast properly; (2) slots and retainer wires work for any bread, muffin or bagel; (3) has not electrocuted any family members or pets; and (4) has not burned our house down.<br /><br />This morning, the shiny replacement unit died after three days of casual use. Six years of service on one, and not even six days of service on the replacement. I am sure this is due to POOR QUALITY CONTROL which allows them to ship an improperly assembled unit, or possibly POOR DESIGN which leads to a high level of &#34;infant mortality&#34; as I see by other reviewers.<br /><br />For the price, this is INEXCUSABLE. I could get an unreliable toaster for one-tenth the price if I wanted one."

3dccdf63-8dc7-4c50-9ffd-e0698a40e105,Kitchen,Virginia Boys Kitchens Black Walnut Wood Cutting Boards with Drip Groove,5,"Love, love, love my wooden cutting boards. The only thing I would suggest is the seller posting how to make a wood conditioner with beeswax and coconut oil. I had to hunt online for a recipe of what ratio to use to melt it together. But they do supply directions on just using the coconut oil, which is also nice -- I just wanted a little more protection on mine, and they suggested beeswax, but I didn't know how to use it was all. But I really liked the directions given on how to clean the board and how to keep it conditioned, etc. I thought I needed to sand it more when it came, but I think the wood is just a softer wood, because it seemed like the more I sanded it, it never got super smooth. So, a mention of that also would be nice on the directions as, I don't think I really needed to sand it anymore - it's just a grainier type of wood that has that rougher feel, and no amount of extra sanding will really get rid of that, so while it might still need to be sanded some when it arrives, don't expect it to feel completely smooth like some wood. And my husband hears me say, every time I use it, how much I love my wooden cutting boards. This one looks beautiful once it's conditioned."

There is a big blue crystal on one side and two tiny blue crystals on the wingtip on the other side.<br /><br />Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.

(No pun intended. Well maybe a little.) I don't drink beer but I saw these and thought that they would be great as gifts for my family and friends that do drink beer. Curiosity got the better of me. I just had to try these things out but not in beer. I popped them in the freezer overnight. I drink a lot of water and a Coke or orange soda fairly often. I like them really cold. I use ice cubes but as someone else stated they water everything down. In addition I like my water filtered. I do have a filter on my icemaker but there is still an after taste in my ice cubes. Anyway I thought I'd give these things are try. I popped one in a Coke(I wish that I had read the review about a beer fizzing. Sodas do too)  I am so surprised and pleased with these.<br /><br />I am actually going to place another order and get a couple sets for my cousins. They entertain a lot and I think they will really enjoy the Cozy Sticks like I have. Oh, they are made for bottles but I put one in my glass of water and the after taste of the ice cubes is now history!. I know this sounds a bit silly but I really like the company logo. It reminds me of something from years ago but I can't remember what. I just know that it makes me smile whenever I see it. Keep Smiling & Dare to Dream!"

494e5e22-b4e8-4652-8a9c-e7baa6ea8b86,Jewelry,King Will GENTLEMENT 8mm Blue and Black Carbon Fiber Tungsten Carbide Ring Wedding Band Polished Finish,5,"First things first, I received this ring free for the purpose of review. Hopefully, my observations and impressions will prove helpful to you in your decision making. If you have questions, feel free to post them in the comments section, and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience with the product.<br /><br />What you're getting with this order:<br /><br />(1) &#34;King Will&#34; 8mm Blue and Black carbon fiber inlay Tungsten Carbide ring.<br /><br />What is Tungsten Carbide, and how does it compare to Tungsten?: Tungsten is an element and Tungsten Carbide an alloy. You will find differing opinions, but many feel that Tungsten Carbide is the better material for a ring because it is essentially scratch resistant to anything but diamond. Both have very similar characteristics when it comes to looks, and the two terms are frequently used interchangeably.<br /><br />The &#34;King Will&#34; Blue and Black 8mm carbon fiber inlay Tungsten Carbide ring: This ring features the polished dark silver of tungsten carbide on the outside with beveled edges while a carbon fiber inlay dominates the center of the ring with flecks of blue noticeable. The black of the carbon fiber contrasts beautifully with the tungsten making for a unique and attractive band, and the blue adds a third color that makes this particular ring unique. The inner ring is comfort fit, meaning that it is contoured and is easier to slide on/off your finger compared to flat bands.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a unique Tungsten Carbide ring that by nature of its construction is very durable and highly scratch resistant. It is well represented in the product description photos, but with the actual product, the carbon fiber is actually more visible with the light playing off its modern pattern. The craftsmanship is excellent. I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a durable and stylish band, and at its current price point one has very little to lose. Enjoy!"

Now I'm addicted. Today I will use Amazon, my go-to supplier, to replacing containers which my girls lost at school, picnics, etc. We use them a lot!  In reading reviews for this product, those who were disappointed seemed for the most part to be using them differently than we are. Lunch and snack items such as  guacamole and  chips, fruits and berries, pretzels, cheese slices, cookies and crackers, other  finger foods, pack beautifully. I claim that I get the colored containers because the little one likes them, but I have to admit that I do too.  However, I don't think these particular containers would work nearly as well for soups or oily foods that could leak. I've put pasta with marinara in them, but would not pack pasta salad with olive oil dressing. I wash them by hand because I don't have a dishwasher.

We also have the option of preparing an entire carafe of coffee to serve as necessary, although at times the  refillable carafe pod leaks grounds.  We haven't used the carafe often, so could be we haven't perfected the pod preparation before brewing yet.<br /><br />The water container is large & doesn't need refilling often.  Easy to clean; base is small so does not take up a lot of counter space.  Nice looking system.  We have ours sitting on top of a black pod storage base with drawers of coffee choices, so the morning routine is simple and quick.  We also use just the hot water to make a bowl of quick oatmeal. We love it.<br /><br />Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review."

At $51, its about 40% less than I have seen this Honesuki elsewhere, and is far cheaper than a decent European style boning knife (which makes it an absurd value).  At this price, it deserves 5 stars.  Not the most exotic material, but fit and finish is quite nice, and I find the shape, as well as the uncommon heft for a Japanese blade, to be a very useful addition to my block.  I have been surprised at how many uses other than boning I have been able to put this knife to.  I have found myself using it to core tomatoes and other vegetables using the tip, and its heft and relevant non-delicacy makes it handy for cutting and pitting avocadoes.  The small, thin tipped, and rigid blade, also makes this the perfect shallot cutting tool.<br /><br />One small potential negative -- at least for me -- is that Tojiro prints its logo and &#34;Made in Japan&#34; in Latin characters on the bottom of the knife -- this is not shown in the pictures above, which I imagine is the version sold in Japan.  I might try to polish this stuff off."

For me I have always had a problem in knowing correct portion sizes for different good groups, or I would just guess at it. This portion control plate takes the hard work and guessing out of it. It is clearly marked as to what a portion is, how many you need a day and what goes into each slot. This is very important now since my husband is a diabetic we are learning to closely watch food, this plate is so helpful and made it simple to follow the guidelines on meal preps. I place it on the plate and fill it up according to the lines marked on it.  There is a chart that comes on the paper it comes with I hung it on the fridge until I learn all the servings per day.<br />This plate would be perfect for those wanting to start a diet, those who are learning to measure foods, who are on restrictive diets as well. Like I said I always had problems in the past before this plate trying to measure foods, this is a one step set up, place it on your plate and fill to lines it is really fool proof even my daughters can use it. Healthy teachings start young around here.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."

First off, it was elegantly packaged (like you'd expect from a high end seller) and out of the box it's gorgeous.<br /><br />Both the gold and tungsten black are shiny (not matte) and the fit (size 11) was perfect.  It has a hunky look to it, this is no dainty band!  It attracts attention much more with the gold in the middle than if the colors were reversed. We constantly get asked where we got it...it really draws attention and adds a modern edge for men that don't feel comfortable with &#34;jewelry&#34;. Right now my husband is wearing this on his wedding ring finger, and another one (tungsten with gold celtic carvings in the middle). This is a guy that hates wearing a watch because it feels like too much jewelry..<br /><br />Now here's the kicker: he swims in a chlorinated pool daily.  DAILY. He works in the yard and does dishes (not as often as I'd like, but you know).  The older one he has looks just as great as the newer one. Still glossy, still smooth. It's so well-beveled that when you cross the band with a fingertip you cannot feel the seam between materials.  Both rings are great, but this BLACK with gold is definitely an attention getter, and the heft of the 8mm width looks good on a bigger guy (he's 6'3&#34; and his old wedding ring looked too thin).<br /><br />Very pleased with the seller and the product.<br /><br />I rec'd this as a sample to review and inspect."

Most variable temperature kettles only provide several temperature settings -- hardly enough for all the different kinds of brew methods as well types of coffee beans/tea leaves. A five degree difference, for example, can make big impact in taste.<br /><br />As for the complaints about rust, I've had my Bonavita for 8 months without any problems. Stainless steel will stain and even rust if it comes into contact with an abrasive cleaner (such as any spray cleaner with bleach) -- which people are likely to be using in their kitchens. If it happens to you just clean it with Bar Keepers Friend. That will clear it up in a few seconds."

I've never had a wine bottle opener that was so easy to use.  It lines up perfectly with the cork, and you don't even have to turn the corkscrew, just press down on the lever.  It may look complicated, but it's so easy to use it doesn't even come with directions.<br /><br />Before applying the wine bottle opener, clasp the accompanying foil cutter around the top of your wine bottle and give it a turn.  It cuts the foil neatly off of the bottle top. My husband always got so grumpy when I used a knife to remove the foil, and I'd be the first to admit it dulls the knife blade. Now he won't have to sharpen our knives nearly as often.<br /><br />Both the opener and the foil cutter come in a nice presentation box.  I just wish my friend had known about this product before she purchased her hundred dollar opener.<br /><br />***product supplied by vendor for testing and review***"

It's seriously awesome to use at parties, at your own house, or even just drinking alone. Definitely helps if you're in a darker area - think outside just hanging out. It'd actually be an ideal cup to have, since it does light up. It can flash, blink, or just stay solid when turned on. I usually use the solid color setting. It's really fun, too, since it'll change the colour of whatever drink you're having. I wasn't expecting the three different settings, so that was a nice surprise. Sometimes too many blinking or flashing lights give me a headache, and I can't handle it, so I appreciate the thoughtfulness of three different lighting options. I plan on buying a few more, especially for such a great price, and giving them to some of my 21+ friends who would enjoy having a cup like this, especially for holidays (New Years) or whenever we're all getting together for a small party. I seriously love this cup, even if it was a bit smaller than I had hoped and expected.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback."

My kids don't particularly like cold sandwiches for lunch day after day, so these will work out well as their school lunch containers.<br /><br />In fact, these sturdy BPA free containers and freezer, microwave, and dishwasher safe, so I'm going to use some of the recipes from one of my favorite books, &#34;Don't Panic, Dinner's in the Freezer&#34;, to make meals in advance and freeze them in these containers to use as needed!  It'll be perfect because the food will thaw as they wait for their lunch hour, then they can microwave it in the cafeteria's microwave and enjoy a hot home made lunch rather than having to eat the &#34;food&#34; they serve at school these days.<br /><br />These food containers would also be perfect for folks on a diet because they could prepare their meals ahead as well as manage their portion size. One of my neighbors is on the Paleo Diet Plan and swears by this book, &#34;Paleo Meal Plan: A Complete 7 Day Paleo Meal Planner with Full Shopping List&#34;.  Of course you don't need to be on a diet to find these food containers useful. They're just as handy to use to put your leftovers away, or take a meal to work with, or to the gym, to take on road trips, or a zillion other uses.<br /><br />They're well made and can stand up to getting bumped, dropped, microwaved, frozen, cleaned in the dishwasher, and stacked when not needed.  The company backs them up with a lifetime guarantee as well, so there's nothing to lose by trying them.<br /><br />Promotional discount provided for product evaluation, testing, and review purposes."

One for my daughter and one for my niece.  They shipped from China, so they did take a while to arrive, however, they were in good condition.  They were wrapped individually in a clear plastic wrapper and were well made.  My daughter spilled something on her bracelet and decided to soak it in soapy water for a couple days (without telling me) and when I found it, all the metal was rusted, so I would suggest not showering with it on.  Each piece is separated on the top, but are all connected to one large piece underneath.  The clasp is easy to use, even if you have to clasp it by yourself.  I would recommend these bracelets to friends and family."

It's not wrong to give a guy a ring, it seems awkward I know. But once my friend saw this ring, she was totally in love with the design. It doesn't mean that this ring is only for engagement or wedding ring purposes. It is also perfect as birthday gifts for boyfriend, husband or even for dad's. <br /><br />Because this ring is impressively beautiful, guys will definitely appreciate your effort. And that's really the case when my friend gave this ring to her boyfriend. My friend came in so dramatically emotional the last time she visited and thanked me. <br /><br />And then I ask my friend before I batched post a review on our purchase. <br /><br />Here's her reply....<br /><br />The stones came out so brightly on day time when the sun shines on it. Her boyfriend wears the ring most of the time aside from going to work. His fingers looks so nice especially when driving and out for a date. The fitting was a little smaller, because we just guess her boyfriend finger size. She wanted to turn it back and request for a change, but her boyfriend insisted that he can't wait for another days to wear it. My friend wanted the ring for her boyfriend's middle finger. Unfortunately, the ring only fits her boyfriend's ring finger. Anyway, they were both happy with that.<br /><br />There were no trace of scratches and damage. Smooth all over the frame and no harsh edges. Her boyfriend's comment...&#34;This ring is absolutely perfect for men who loves fashion wear.&#34;<br /><br />My friend was happy also for the very affordable price she got for a very nice men's ring."

It came packaged in bubble wrap with no scratches.  It is a dark amber color to filter out the light & glass so no leaching.  This is especially important if you put anything citrusy in it.  I love the sprayer on this - it covers a very wide surface area.  This is perfect for homemade bug spray.  The cap fits on tight so no worries about it leaking anywhere.<br />My bug spray recipe in case anyone wants to try it is: (this is for this 2 oz size)<br />Fill bottle 2/3 way with distilled water.  Then the remaining 1/3 with witch hazel.  (witch hazel will act as an emulsifier) .  Then I add about 10-12 drops of essential oils - I use Purification as the majority & then add in some others depending on what I have but these are all great bug deterrents:  Purification (my favorite), Citronella, Lemongrass, Peppermint (ants/bees really hate this one so I also make an ant/bee spray that I spray around my house), Lavender, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Patchouli, & Geranium.<br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."

If I sit it on the counter to use the numbers go crazy. I can't get it to zero out anymore which renders the Tare function useless. I get negative read offs or sometimes not even a set number. One item will send the scale crazy. I've tried changing the batteries out or leaving the scale alone to let it adjust and it just continues to flash tons of numbers. Not sure what happened because this thing gets stored safely in a cabinet in the box. Going to have to shop around for a more accurate functioning scale.

My one word of caution is these scissors come about, which is stated in the description, but they come apart very easily.  I took them out of the box when they arrived and while opening them up to help my husband open a second amazon box, they came apart and on side fell to the ground nearly missing my foot.  I like the fact the scissors come apart, but it should require a bit more effort.  I would like see some sort of safety to prevent unintentional separations.  This is the reason I took one star away.  With that in mid these are still great scissors, but I am much more careful when using them now and I try not to open them too wide to prevent them from coming apart while using.  I haven't had any issues since the first day now that I am aware of how they work.  The blades of the scissor are sharp and the handles feel good while using them.  The scissors come in a very nice looking, easy to open box with a plastic tray designed to hold the scissors.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."

ae51fb44-156a-4ed2-8b4d-88da1acf1f2b,Kitchen,The Abundant Kitchen Slim Coffee Grinder and Burr Spice Mill | Moneyback Guarantee | Glass Bottom | Perfect Size for a Cup of Joe,1,"I received a discounted item to provide feedback based upon my experiences with the product.  My husband wanted a manual coffee grinder for small batches of freshly ground coffee. I liked the fact that the base of this coffee grinder was made of glass. It was the perfect size for small batches. Once filled, it didn't take long to get the desired amount of coffee beans ground.  This grinder did not come with instructions, so it took us a minute or two to figure out that you needed to completely disassemble the unit to be able to fill it with coffee beans. It's easy to adjust the grind with the coffee with just a twist of the screw on top.  Unfortunately, the screw that the handle attaches to bent after the first use. The bend in the screw caused the plastic top to rub against the screw, and we ended up with metal shavings in the grinder and ground coffee. We didn't catch this until we had already put the grinds in the french press and disassembled the unit to add more beans for grinding.  Given our experience with the grinder, I can not recommend this grinder and will be sending it back."

It's simplistic design goes well with any kitchen design and it's really simple to use. It's wide opening also makes it easy to fill the grinder up.

Not too sure what happened but it works fine now and it's great! I love having fresh pepper and salt with a simple twist."

This thing is stunning. I've gotten so many compliments on it to. Quality is exceptional. The comfort fit is perfect. The carbon fiber inlay makes it so different and stand out but it's not flashy.

I got this bracelet because of the tree of life charm. Plus the leather is light weight and I don't like wearing heavy bracelets. This has not come off my wrist since I got it over a month ago! It does not have clasps, it ties so that you can adjust the wrist size. The only clasp is to the hanging charm. I must admit confusion of how so many people said theirs broke the first day etc. I went on vacation with it, have 3 kids and one on the way,  get showers in it, soak in the bath, wash dishes, sleep in it....like I said I have not taken it off once. Because of its durability I am back to buy more from the seller. I love it and recommend it highly!"

They are always so beautiful.<br />This Swarovski Elements Crystal Heart Shaped Bracelet is gorgeous!<br />It is made of White Gold Plated Alloy which should hold up really well without rusting like regular plated jewelry. And Alloy is so much easier to keep clean and shiny.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars only because It is a little on the small side, luckily I have smaller wrists so it fits but is still a little snug. If you have bigger wrists then it might not fit you. And it is very hard to put it on yourself.<br /><br />I really love how the crystals sparkle when the sun hits them. It looks so beautiful and stunning. The hearts are different sizes. The middle one is bigger then it goes smaller and smaller which makes it a really beautiful design.<br /><br />It came in a beautiful gift box with a cleaning cloth to keep your bracelet shiny.<br />This bracelet looks gorgeous no matter what I wear it with so it's very versatile.<br />This would make a great present for any woman in your life. And it would also make the best Bridesmaid gift.<br /><br />** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.
